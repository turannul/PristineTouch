# PristineTouch
PristineTouch is a macOS app for disabling your input devices temporarily &mdash; perfect for cleaning your keyboard without having to shut down!

## Usage
Start the app PristineTouch, your screen will show symbol and keyboard & mouse/trackpad have been disabled.

## Accessibility Access
If you are running PristineTouch for the first time, you may need to grant it accessibility access. Usually, macOS will show a system dialog with instructions to do so. If it does not, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility and grant PristineTouch access.

## Event Taps
PristineTouch creates an event tap to disable input. If you are running software that detects (and possibly terminates) programs doing this, you might need to whitelist PristineTouch.

## Note
This program does not automatically clean your keyboard. It only assists in the process of doing so.
